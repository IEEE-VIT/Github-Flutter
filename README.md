## Getting Started
* Fork it.
* Clone your forked repo and move inside it:\
`git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/<repo-name>.git && cd <repo-name>`

* Checkout to a new branch to work on an issue:\
`git checkout -b my-amazing-feature`

* Now you can open the project.
* Run `flutter pub get` in the project terminal and get the dependencies.
* Use `flutter run debug` to run the app in your local emulator.
* Once you're all done coding, it's time to open a PR :)
Run the following commands from the root of the project directory:
\
`git add .`\
`git commit -m "A short description about the feature."`\
`git push origin <my-amazing-feature>`

Open your forked repo in your browser and then raise a PR to the `master` branch of this repository!
